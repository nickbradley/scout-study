I was intimitated by this Prolific task, but right now I am dealing with React (Javascript, HTML and CSS) for a project I have with some teammates whoa re actually using pure Javascript, creating APIs, connecting their back-end with front-end with lines of code and words I've never seen before. However, this tool and pretty much this whole study is doing God's work for me, by giving me a brief introduction to some array functions I've seen them use like filter() and the reducer; I feel like this tool would help me so much to learn as much as they do regarding Back-end, the juice of the project. I feel like a god using this tool, I have learned plenty so far and I know this is pretty basic and a very, very brief introduction to the actual language, but I can feel its inmense potential and future spot as a must-have VS extension.

I see now looking above at the solution where I went wrong as I was making changes to the wrong area. The links I looked at were also a bit misleading or I interpreted them poorly. Given an extra few minutes I may have come to this solution.|My own judgement should have been better to apply the previews.|
